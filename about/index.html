					<h4>Career Aim</h4>
					<p>My life dream is to be among the best developers in the Fourth industral revolution. I have completed my A-levels courses, where I studied physics, chemistry, and both mathematics and further mathematics. Having achieved C’s in my sciences and B’s in my mathematics. Even though these academic qualifications are important, another requirement is a good occupational background. I have had a couple of work placements underlined under work experience.</p>

I have decent mental and physical strength. I am also good at calculations and maths related tasks. I am also good with electronics and tech problems if I know what my end result should vaguely look like. I can work a computer at an advanced level.</p>
